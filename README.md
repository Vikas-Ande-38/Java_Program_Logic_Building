# Java Data Types - Notes and Examples

This repository contains basic notes and sample Java programs to demonstrate the use of **data types** in Java programming. 
Data types determine the kind of values a variable can store and how those values can be manipulated.

## 🧠 What are Data Types?

Data types define the **type of data** a variable can hold, such as integers, decimals, characters, or logical values. Java has two categories:

1. **Primitive Data Types** – byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean  
2. **Non-Primitive Data Types** – String, Arrays, Classes, etc.

## 🔹 Primitive Data Types

| Type      | Size      | Example     | Description                       |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| `byte`    | 1 byte    | 127         | Small integers                    |
| `short`   | 2 bytes   | 32000       | Larger than byte                  |
| `int`     | 4 bytes   | 100000      | Common integer type               |
| `long`    | 8 bytes   | 123456789L  | Very large integers               |
| `float`   | 4 bytes   | 3.14f       | Decimal values with less precision|
| `double`  | 8 bytes   | 3.14159     | Double precision decimal numbers  |
| `char`    | 2 bytes   | 'A'         | Single character                  |
| `boolean` | 1 bit     | true / false| Logical values                    |

## 🔸 Non-Primitive Data Types

- `String`: Stores text, e.g., `"Hello"`
- Arrays: Stores multiple values of the same type
- Classes & Interfaces

## 🧪 Sample Java Programs

All examples are located in the `src/` directory.

DAY TWO 

# 🧠 Java Conditional Logic Project

This project demonstrates the use of **`if-else`, `else-if`, and `switch-case`** statements in Java using **real-world decision-making scenarios**.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `RealLifeScenarios.java`: Contains methods for problems using **`if-else-if`** conditions.
- `SwitchCaseScenarios.java`: Contains methods for problems using **`switch-case`** with multiple logic conditions.

---

## ✅ Concepts Covered

### 🔹 `if-else-if` Scenarios

1. **Passport and Visa Eligibility**  
2. **University Admission Based on Percentage, Sports, and Income**  
3. **Shopping Discount Calculation**  
4. **Fitness App Recommendation Based on BMI and Age**  
5. **Campus Placement Eligibility**

### 🔸 `switch-case` Scenarios

1. **Banking Transactions: Withdraw, Deposit, Transfer**  
2. **E-commerce Return Policy**  
3. **College Course Selection Based on Semester & Department**  
4. **Food Delivery App Modes: Pickup, Delivery, Dine-in**  
5. **Online Test Navigation: MCQ, Code, Essay**
